# ORF Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Online Recruitment Fraud (ORF) Detection** using advanced deep learning approaches.  
It aims to identify fraudulent job postings by analyzing job descriptions, company details, and other text-based features.

The system helps job seekers avoid scams by detecting suspicious postings using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Transformer-based models** such as **BERT** and **RoBERTa**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- **Models:** BERT, RoBERTa, LSTM, GRU  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Web Integration:** Flask / Django  
- **Mapping:** Leaflet.js (optional feature)
